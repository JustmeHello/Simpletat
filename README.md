# Nice Tat

Astro Site Template inspired by Casey Neistat’s ultra minimal personal site. 

Great for a LinkInBio type site or just a placeholder while you work on getting your personal site right for the next 35 years.

## 🚀 How to setup

Simply click one of the deploy buttons above, fill in the site details and your site should be running in about 2 mins. 



## ✏️ Editing the Site

You can edit the site directly on GitHub or clone the repo to your local machine. 


## 📄 Adding a new page

To add a new page simply create a new Markdown file in the /src/pages directory, Example: /src/pages/twitch.md, and add your content and options. 

You can also copy and paste an existing markdown file. 


## 🌍 Site Wide Options

You can customize the site name as well as other options for the whole site in src/config.ts


## ❓ Why not add X, Y, and Z?

Because HTML is a beautiful language not everything needs to use the latest tool for building a planet scale multi-tenant sharded vector database backed web application. 

If you really want to extend the site the Astro Docs should get you pretty far: https://docs.astro.build/en/getting-started/
