If you're trying to reach out to say hello or say something nice you should @ me on Twitter, I try to respond to as many posts as possible.

​

If you have a question about making videos or want to share something you made with me or anything like that I would also direct you to Twitter.  I know that's not as satisfying as sending a direct email but my inbox is a big fat mess and when I made it public there were too many messages to respond so they just went unread - that sucks for everyone.  

​

If you are in NYC and want to connect personally or have a business idea you want to talk to me about or want a couple minutes of my time on the phone or in person or if you want to connect for a quick selfie or anything that involves a commitment of time, any amount of time, I very very gently have to say no. 

 

Saying no is hard.  There are so many extraordinary circumstances that should warrant me saying yes, but I can't.  It's a hard, inflexible no.

​

Family comes first, work second and whatever is left over I like to use for me which is usually going to the gym or running.  There is no time left for yes.  Even if that means missing opportunities.  

​

Paul Graham really nails why saying yes for a quick coffee can be so destructive to the creative process - give this a read to understand the maker's schedule.

​

My dear friend Ryan Holiday penned this pointed essay to everyone who asks for just a little of your time.  It's brilliant, I wish I'd written it.

​

I am sorry for no, but it's not without reason.
